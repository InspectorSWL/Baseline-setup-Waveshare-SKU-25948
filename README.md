# RGB Baseline Bring-Up

[esp_lcd](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/api-reference/peripherals/lcd.html) provides several panel drivers out-of box, e.g. ST7789, SSD1306, NT35510. However, there're a lot of other panels on the market, it's beyond `esp_lcd` component's responsibility to include them all.

`esp_lcd` allows user to add their own panel drivers in the project scope (i.e. panel driver can live outside of esp-idf), so that the upper layer code like LVGL porting code can be reused without any modifications, as long as user-implemented panel driver follows the interface defined in the `esp_lcd` component.

This workspace is pared back to a raw RGB panel baseline for hardware bring-up. It initializes the CH422G expander, resets the panel, enables the backlight, and cycles full-screen solid colors so timing and data-lane issues are easy to spot before LVGL or touch input are added back.

## How to use the example

## ESP-IDF Required

### Hardware Required

* An ESP32-S3R8 development board
* A ST7701 LCD panel, with RGB interface
* An USB cable for power supply and programming

### Hardware Connection

The connection between ESP Board and the LCD is as follows:

```

```

* The LCD timing parameters and GPIO assignments live in `main/waveshare_rgb_lcd_port.h`.
* The only project-specific menuconfig option kept for this baseline is the RGB bounce buffer height.

### Configure the Project

Run `idf.py menuconfig` and navigate to `Example Configuration -> Display` if you want to adjust the RGB bounce buffer height.

### Build and Flash

Run `idf.py set-target esp32s3` to select the target chip.

Run `idf.py -p PORT build flash monitor` to build, flash and monitor the project. The display should cycle white, red, green, and blue full-screen fills.

The first time you run `idf.py` for the example will cost extra time as the build system needs to address the component dependencies and downloads the missing components from registry into `managed_components` folder.

(To exit the serial monitor, type ``Ctrl-]``.)

See the [Getting Started Guide](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/get-started/index.html) for full steps to configure and use ESP-IDF to build projects.
